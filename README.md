# README

Welcome to the COVID-19 Map project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive visualization of COVID-19 cases worldwide. By using a combination of powerful web technologies, the site allows users to view real-time data on COVID-19 cases, helping to inform and educate the public. Below, you'll find detailed information about the technologies used to build this project, the features it offers, and how to get started.

## Technologies Used

### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of the web application's structure. It is used to create the layout of the web pages, ensuring that the content is well-organized and accessible. HTML forms the foundation upon which JavaScript and other technologies build dynamic and interactive features.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is the primary programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web application. It handles data fetching, processing, and rendering on the client side. JavaScript enables real-time updates of COVID-19 data, providing users with the latest information. Libraries such as D3.js or Leaflet.js may also be used for data visualization and mapping.

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store COVID-19 case data. Its flexible schema design allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of complex and varied data sets. MongoDB's powerful querying capabilities ensure that the application can handle large volumes of data and provide quick access to the latest COVID-19 statistics.

### Postman
Postman is a powerful tool for API development and testing. It is used to create, test, and document the API endpoints that the application relies on to fetch COVID-19 data. Postman ensures that all API calls are functioning correctly and efficiently, providing a user-friendly interface for making HTTP requests and viewing responses.

### Jest
Jest is a testing framework used to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application's code. It is employed to write and run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Jest's robust testing capabilities help maintain high code quality and prevent regressions, ensuring that all features work as expected.

## Features

### Global COVID-19 Data Visualization
The main feature of the application is the visualization of global COVID-19 data. The map provides an interactive interface where users can view the number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in different regions. The data is updated in real-time, giving users access to the latest statistics.

### Data Filtering and Search
Users can filter data by country, region, and date range. This feature allows for a more detailed analysis of the COVID-19 situation in specific areas. The search functionality enables users to quickly find information about particular locations, enhancing the usability and accessibility of the data.

### Real-Time Updates
The application fetches the latest COVID-19 data from reliable sources and updates the visualization in real-time. This ensures that users always have access to the most current information, making the site a valuable resource for tracking the spread of the virus.

### User-Friendly Interface
The website is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. The use of HTML and JavaScript ensures that the interface is responsive and accessible on various devices. Interactive elements such as tooltips and clickable map regions enhance the user experience.
